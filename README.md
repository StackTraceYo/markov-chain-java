# markov-chain-java
Read this cool thing about [Markov Chains](http://setosa.io/ev/markov-chains/) and wanted to implement one.

To see if it works I got Twitter data from [Trump Twitter Archive](http://www.trumptwitterarchive.com/), and the TrumpTweetGenerator class uses that data to print out some "tweets". The implementation is not specific to TrumpTweets just the use of it in this project.

See test case for usage
